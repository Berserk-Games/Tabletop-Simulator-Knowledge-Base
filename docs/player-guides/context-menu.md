The Context Menu is the menu that appears when you `right-click` while in-game, generally on an Object. You can do pretty much anything in the Contextual Menu, with deck and dice options, tinting, saving to chest, scripting and much more.

##Options
Depending on the object you right click on, the Contextual Menu may show different options. You can always save the object to your Chest, tint the color of it, modify the physics, flip it over or rotate it, copy and delete it. You can also give the object a name and description. The “Name” field will show over the object as a tool tip with the description appearing if the mouse continues to hover there for over a second.

##Toggles
The Toggles sub-menu allows you to change how this object interacts with the rest of the game.
