There are a lot of controls in Tabletop Simulator and this article will mostly go over the lesser known controls that you may not be aware of. Remember to open up the [Help Menu](/getting-started/help-menu) to see the list of controls.

You can read about the basic controls and movement [here](/player-guides/basic-controls).

!!!tip "Many of these controls can be changed in the Settings menu."

Peek at the underside of an Object.

> Holding ALT and clicking SHIFT while hovering over an Object shows the underside.

###Number Keys
There are two sets of number keys on the standard keyboard.

####Number Row
Draw a number of items.

> With the pointer over a stack/bag/deck, typing in a number will draw that many cards after 1 second.

!!!tip "The 1 second delay allows you to type multiple numbers. So pressing 1 then 2 quickly will draw 12 cards."

There is an alternative method for drawing multiple cards:

1. Draw a first card by clicking and dragging
2. While keeping that card held, hover over the deck
3. Right click as many times as cards you want to draw

####Number Pad
Activate scripting via hotkeys.

> By default, these keys can trigger scripting. If there is no scripting, they perform no action.

---

##Alt Modifier
By default, Alt shows a zoomed preview of the object the mouse is hovering over. When holding onto an object it is also used as a modifier for other keys.

Grab an object and, while holding it, try the following actions out.

###Alt + rotate (Q/E/Scroll wheel)
Rotate on a different axis.

###Alt + flip (MMB)
Flips on a different axis.

###Alt + drop (RMB)
Drops the last grabbed Object or the bottom card of a held deck.

###Alt + scale (Shift+Q/E)
Alternative scaling method.
