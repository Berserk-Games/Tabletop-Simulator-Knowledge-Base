###Number Keys
There are two sets of number keys on the standard keyboard.

####Number Row
Draw a number of items.

> With the pointer over a stack/bag/deck, typing in a number will draw that many cards after 1 second.

!!!tip "The 1 second delay allows you to type multiple numbers. So pressing 1 then 2 quickly will draw 12 cards."

####Number Pad
Activate scripting via hotkeys.

> By default, these keys can trigger scripting. If there is no scripting, they perform no action.

##ALT Modifier
By default, ALT shows a zoomed preview of the Object the mouse is hovering over. But it is also used as a modifier for other keys.
