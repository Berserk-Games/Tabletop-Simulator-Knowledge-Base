##Turns Menu
The turns menu allows for control over how turns work, and in what order.

Setting Name | What It Does
-- | --
**Turns** | Enable the turns system
**Type** | Choose between default turn order or enable order customization.
**Order** | If `Custom` `Type` is selected, drag-and-drop colors to change turn order
**Reverse&nbsp;Order** | Reverse order (default is left-to-right)
**Skip&nbsp;Empty Hands** | Skip over player seats that are not occupied
**Pass&nbsp;Turns** | Allow players to pass turns (see Using Turns)
**Disable&nbsp;Interactions** | Blocks player interactions if it is not their turn.


##Using Turns
When turns are enabled, the first player hears a sound and gets a prompt on their screen. After taking their turn, players click `End Turn` at the top of the screen.

If enabled, you can also give the active turn to another player by clicking on the player's name in the upper right and selecting `Pass Turn`.
