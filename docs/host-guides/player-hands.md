Hand zones are a critical part of Tabletop Simulator and have many uses.

* Acting as the player's "seat"
* Being where player names are displayed
* Holding any cards or objects
* Receiving dealt cards/objects
* Hiding cards from select players
* Invisible {>>unless a held object is moved into it<<}
* Displaying its contents on the player screen

If needed, you can read about creating hand zones on the [Zone Tool](../game-tools/zone-tools.md#hand-zone) page.
