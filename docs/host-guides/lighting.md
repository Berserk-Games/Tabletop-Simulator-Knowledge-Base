!!!tip "Use with AssetBundles"
    AssetBundles can also have built-in lighting effects for local light sources or movable spotlights. Together with scene lighting, very atmospheric setups are possible.

##Access Lighting
Access the Lighting menu in-game at the top of the screen: **Options > Lighting**.

Modifications made to the Lighting are part of the table and will be saved along with it.

##Lighting Settings
Below is a list of accessible attributes and what they do.

Setting Name | What It Does
-- | --
**Light&nbsp;Intensity** | Use the slider to change the intensity of the light shining from above. This also affects the strength of the shadows.
**Light&nbsp;Color** | The color you choose with the color picker will affect what your light looks like shining from above.
**Ambient&nbsp;Intensity** | For the Ambient Intensity, you can choose how strong or light you’d like the ambient or “mood lighting” to be.
**Ambient** | You can choose between one of the default backgrounds for lighting or customize it further by choosing the Gradient option.
**Gradient&nbsp;Colors** | If `Gradient` was chosen, this allows you to choose 3 colors to give more ambient lighting choices.
**Reflection&nbsp;Intensity** | This slider will effect how strong the reflections are on shiny objects.
**LUT** | Choose from 115 different options to make even bigger changes to your lighting and atmosphere. You can view details about LUT on [the Unity page](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PostProcessing-UserLut.html).
**LUT&nbsp;Contribution** | This slider changes the intensity of your LUT. By default, it is at max setting so you can see it at its strongest.
**Custom&nbsp;LUT** | If you know how to make your own LUTs, you can upload a custom one to use. Just make sure the dimensions are 256×16.
