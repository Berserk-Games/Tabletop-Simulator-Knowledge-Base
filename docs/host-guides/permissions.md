Hosts can control a multitude of options to prevent players from doing certain actions.

##How Permission Works
A host always has access to all systems within Tabletop Simulator, but they also have the ability to block access to many of them to individuals who join their game.

Promoted players are **not** restricted.

All options are enabled (checked) by default.
