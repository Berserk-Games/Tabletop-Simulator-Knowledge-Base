##Adding Elements
In the Cloud Manager Menu, clicking on the folder icon to the left of the search bar will allow you to upload a file from your computer to your cloud.

Additionally, any time you are prompted to select an image/model/assetbundle for a custom object, you will be asked if you would like to upload the object automatically to your cloud. Selecting `Cloud` will automatically fill in the URL.

!!!tip
    Remember to save after performing this action. You are changing the source for all the game assets and if you do not save, the old save will still point to the old assets.

    This works great when you have been building something locally that is ready for multiplayer or have files cached from a mod that you friend can't get anymore.

##Removing Elements
In the Cloud Manager Menu, mouse-over the item you want to delete. A box with 3 dots will appear. Clicking on it will allow you to select `Delete` to permanently remove the element.

!!!warning "Deleting an element CANNOT be undone."
