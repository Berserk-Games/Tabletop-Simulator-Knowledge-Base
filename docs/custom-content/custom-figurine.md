Looking for a simple way to import a standee/figurine/meeple into your game without any 3D modeling? Custom Figurine allows you to do that, and all you need is an image.

##Importing Custom Figurine
In-game, navigate to the top of your screen and select **Objects > Components > Custom > Custom Figurine**.

![Figurine Creation](/img/custom-figurine/import.png){: style="display:block; margin:0 auto;"}

!!!warning "Importing Assets"
    How you choose to import files impacts if other players can see them when you're finished.<br>For help with importing, visit [Asset Hosting](asset-importing.md).

###Front and Back Images
If you use different images for the front/back back, each side will have its own image.
