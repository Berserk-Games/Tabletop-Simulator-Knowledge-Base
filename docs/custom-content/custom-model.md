It is possible to import 3D Models into the game, complete with their own diffuse, colliders, sounds, specular intensity and more!

##Importing Custom Model
In-game, navigate to the top of your screen and select **Objects > Components > Custom > Custom Model**.

<center>![Model Import Menu](/img/custom-model/import.png)</center>

!!!warning "Importing Assets"
    How you choose to import files impacts if other players can see them when you're finished.<br>For help with importing, visit [Asset Importing](asset-importing).

###Import Options
There are two tabs, Model and Material, which contain all the options for importing a single model.

####Model Options
These options determine the basic, physical aspects of the custom object.

Setting Name | Description
-- | --
Model/Mesh | **(Required)** The model for the 3D object.
Diffuse/Image | **(Required)** The primary material for the object.
Normal/Bump | Normal/bump map image for the object.
Collider | Customized collider. By default, a simple collider is generated automatically.
Non-Convex | If the object is non-convex.
Type | The model's type. See the [Model Type](#model-type) section.

####Material Options

Setting Name | Description
-- | --
Material | Determines the fault material settings, as well as the audio profile used for when the 3D object collides with others.
Specular Intensity | The level of specular intensity.
Specular Color | Specular color setting.
Specular Sharpness | Specular sharpness setting.
Fresnel Strength | Fresnel Strength setting.
Cast Shadows | If the object casts shadows.

Read more about Specular Settings and Fresnel in the [Unity Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StandardShaderMaterialParameters.html).

###Model Type
When making your model, you can decide what the model will be used for. Each selection has its own special attributes.

Setting Name | Description
-- | --
Generic | &#8226; No special attributes.
Figurine | &#8226; Automatically rights itself when picked up into its "vertical" orientation.
Dice* | &#8226; Randomizes object rotation when shaken or the "roll" key is used.<br>&#8226; Number keys will cause it to face a given direction.
Coin* | &#8226; Randomizes object rotation when shaken or the "roll" key is used.<br>&#8226; Object flips up into the air when released after being shaken.
Board | &#8226; Object accepts grid projections by default.<br>&#8226; Alt-zoom will not work on it.<br>&#8226; It ignores hidden zones, always remaining visible.
Chip | &#8226; Object can stack with others of its own type.
Bag | &#8226; Can contain other objects dropped onto it.
Infinite | &#8226; Like a bag, but it contains an infinite number of the first object placed into it.

<sup>&#42; Values can be assigned to these objects, just like regular or custom dice have. See the [rotation vector tool](/game-tools/gizmo-tool#rotation-value) section for details.</sup>

##Custom Model Tips
Making custom objects allows for a lot of freedom, so here are some guidelines you will need to follow when creating your models.

###Valid File Formats

* Model/Mesh file format: `.obj`
* Collider file format: `.obj`
* Image file format: `.jpg` *or* `.png`

###Model Tips

* Triangulate all meshes/models to avoid holes.
* Make sure the normals on your mesh are facing the right direction.
* Set the origin point of the model to the center of mass for best physics. Objects in TTS rotate around their origin point.
* Don’t go crazy with poly counts, use a normal map to add fine detail.
* Keep the vertices below 25k for best results, as any higher your objects may not import and/or crash your game.
* If you want to access additional elements for importing a Model, you might be interested in [Custom AssetBundles](custom-assetbundle) instead.

###Collider Tips

* If you do not specify a custom mesh collider .obj, then the game will calculate a box collider to fit your object.
* Custom mesh collider is just a way for you to have a collider that isn’t a box.
* Only use a custom mesh collider if a box collider will not work, due to performance.
* Box colliders are much more optimized in the physics engine.
* It’s best to use a simplified version of your model with less than 255 triangles. (As simple as possible)
* If your model is already sufficiently low poly enough you can use the same for the Custom Mesh Collider.

###Non-Convex Tips

* Non-convex colliders allow collisions to work like the Chinese Checkers board which has indents and is concave.
* Convex colliders will fill in any indents or holes in the mesh due to how it calculates the collider.
* The problem with non-convex colliders it only works properly on locked object.
* If you need concave colliders and also need the object to move then you must use compound colliders.

###Compound Collider Tips

* Compound colliders are multiple meshes inside one .obj file that create multiple colliders on a singular object.
* Compound colliders allow you make concave shapes and get around the fact that you can’t have non-convex colliders that move.
* Break you mesh into multiple convex shapes then export them in a single .obj file to create compound colliders.
* Non-convex should be set to false (unchecked) when using compound colliders.
