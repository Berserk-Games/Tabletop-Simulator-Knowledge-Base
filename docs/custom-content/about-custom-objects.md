##Object Type Requirements
When creating a game object, there are varying requirements depending on the end-product you want and which tool you choose to create it.

###Image Only
These types of objects only require an image to make the in-game object.

* [Custom Board](custom-board)
* [Custom Deck](custom-board)\*
* [Custom Dice](custom-dice)\*
* [Custom Figurine](custom-figurine)
* [Custom Jigsaw](custom-jigsaw)
* [Custom Tile](custom-tile)
* [Custom Token](custom-token)

<sup>* These object types have special tools/templates to help creating the image.</sup>

###Image and Model
These types of objects require an image as well as a 3d model.

* [Custom Model](custom-model)
* [Asset Bundle](custom-assetbundle) - {>>Requires Unity to assemble<<}

    These are flexible object types, and allow for your model to be treated by the game as many of the other custom object types (dice/board/etc).
