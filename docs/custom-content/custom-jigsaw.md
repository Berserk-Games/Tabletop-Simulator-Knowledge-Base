You can select how many pieces the jigsaw puzzle will have (20-320) as well as if the image will appear on the board too, as a guide.

!!!tip "Shuffling pieces or Checking if Solved"
    If you right-click on the game box, you will see 2 content menu options: `Check` and `Shuffle`. `Check` will check if you have completed the puzzle. `Shuffle` will take all game pieces and shuffle them around the board.
