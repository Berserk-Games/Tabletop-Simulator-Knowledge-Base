There are many different dice in the game, but sometimes you just need your own. This can be done by modeling your own dice as a [Custom Model](custom-model) or [AssetBundle](custom-assetbundle). However if you are looking a way to import your own dice without any of the complications of model creation, the Custom Dice tool is for you.

##Dice Template
The Dice Template, as well as other modding tools, can be found on your computer. Instructions to locate them can be found in the [modding tools](modding-tools) section.

These templates allow for the creation of any of the following dice types: D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20.

###Modifying Dice Template
Take the template of your choice and open it in your preferred image editing program. Edit your dice however you like, saving the result as a new file.

!!!important
    Make sure you don't save over the original template!
