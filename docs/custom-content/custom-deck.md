##Deck Features
* Decks can be square or rectangular, depending on dimensions of card sheet.
* Cards may be held in [hand zones](/game-tools/zone-tools#hand-zone) by default. This can be changed via its [context menu](/player-guides/context-menu#toggles).
* Multiple card sheets can be combined into larger decks if needed.
* Card sheets use the last image on a card sheet for a "hidden" image when those cards are in a hand-zone or otherwise hidden.

##Creating a Card Sheet
A deck is created from a card sheet, which is an array of images which get "cut up" into cards by the game engine. There are two methods to create these sheets, Template and Deck Builder.

###Card Sheet Template
This is the simplest way to create a card sheet. Place your card images in the relevant template and then save the resulting image. In your Steam install directory are two general-use templates for creating a card sheet.

    * In **Steam**, go to your **Library**
    * **Right Click** on **Tabletop Simulator** and select **Properties**
    * In the Properties Menu, click **Local Files** at the top
    * Click **Browse Local Files**

###Deck Builder
This tool is a little more complicated, but allows for control over the number of cards per sheet. The Deck Editor was created by **Froghut**. The Deck Builder utility is located in your game's Steam folder.
