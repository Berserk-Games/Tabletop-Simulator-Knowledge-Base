Custom Tokens are similar to Custom Tiles, in that they can be used to make tile/token-like game objects. The difference is that Custom Tokens are able to "cut out" the transparency of an image to make a token with a customized shape.

##Importing Custom Token
In-game, navigate to the top of your screen and select **Objects > Components > Custom > Custom Token**.

!!!warning "Importing Assets"
    How you choose to import files impacts if other players can see them when you're finished.<br>For help with importing, visit [Asset Importing](asset-importing).

###Import Options

!!!tip "Token Tinting"
    When you use the in-game object tinting feature on a custom token, it tints the whole token, including the image.

##Tips
* Images that have a transparency in the middle (like a donut) will not cut out the transparency in the middle of the image.
* If you are having trouble with the transparency not getting cut out properly, try to add a small transparent border around the entire image. It helps.
* [Custom Tiles](custom-tile) load faster than Custom Tokens. If you can use a custom tile instead, it is almost always preferable.
