Tabletop Simulator allows you to use files, either online or offline, to play custom-made games. Any time a custom asset is being created in-game, you have a choice on how the file is hosted.

##Local Files
These are files that are hosted on your own computer. **Other players CANNOT see these assets!** These are for local games only.


##Online Files
These are files that are hosted online. Other players are able to download and see these assets as long as the host remains active. There are two ways to host your files online.

###Steam Cloud
You get 100GB worth of storage tied to you Steam Account for Tabletop Simulator, and any files uploaded to your steam account through Tabletop Simulator will persist indefinitely. This makes it an ideal file host. See the [Cloud Manager](cloud-manager) page for details on using this hosting method.

###Third Party Hosts
You can use any online host for your files by simply posting the URL of the file into the asset prompt. However third party hosts may have rules or restrictions that prevent your assets from being shared correct or being hosted indefinitely.

> It is strongly recommended that you use Steam Cloud hosting instead.

##Cached Files
When you download assets for a custom game, they are saved on your computer indefinitely. This way, you do not need to download them again if you load up the same custom game a second time. By default, **Mod Caching** is on. It can be toggled off if the game's settings menu.

!!!tip
    If you are able to see files that are hosted online but someone else cannot, it may be because you have these files Cached. A possible solution would be to use [Steam Cloud](cloud-manager) to re-host the files.
