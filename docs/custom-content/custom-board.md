A custom board is a game board created using any image.

##Board Features
* The dimensions of the board will be based off the dimensions of the image used.
* The board starts off as "locked" and can be unlocked via its [context menu](/player-guides/context-menu#toggles).
* Boards accept "grids" by default. This too can be changed via the [context menu](/player-guides/context-menu#toggles).

!!!info "See [Asset Resolution](asset-resolution) for suggested image resolution."
