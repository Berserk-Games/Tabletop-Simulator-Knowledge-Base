When using [Global Chat](in-game-communication#global-chat), there is an expectation that discussion will be centered around Tabletop Simulator, tabletop games and finding games to play.

The global chat is moderated to prevent spamming, griefing, and excessive behavior. There are bots that auto kick for saying certain words and most profanities will show up as <censored> to everyone except for the person who originally posted it. TTS is considered family friendly, which is why we are moderating the chat. We canâ€™t moderate other parts of the game, but the global chat is easier with the help of our moderators. The global chat is part of the Geekshed network and they have [their own rules](http://www.geekshed.net/tos/) which also need to be followed.

##Rules
These rules only apply to Global Chat, not in-game chat.

1. **Please keep chat in English**. It is alright to send a message or two to find other players, but General chat needs to be kept in English. You can private message other players through Steam or by using `/msg <nickname> <message>` (without the <>)
2. **Do not try to get around filters**. They are there for a reason.
3. **Do not harass players or moderators**. It is ok to disagree, but doing so to the detriment of conversation or flinging abuse is not acceptable.
4. **Remember TTS is family friendly**. Keep younger audiences in mind before you speak.
5. **Ignore trolls**. If someone is trolling, just ignore them. A moderator should get rid of them shortly. Replying to or playing along with trolls is a great way to get lumped in with them when they are removed.
6. **Keep religion/politics out of it**. This chat is for the discussion of tabletop. It is not a place to debate beliefs.
7. **If you get kicked from a game, keep it to yourself**. A game host is able to kick you for any reason. If they kicked you for a bad reason, they are a jerk. Don't play with them in the future. But do not share your opinions on their hosting methods in Global. If you want to ask them why, use Steam or /msg.
8. **Do not argue publicly with mods**. If you do not like something a moderator did, you can ask them why they did it using `/msg name` in private. If they do not respond, or if you feel they have been abusive, you can contact `berserkgames@gmail.com`. Do not complain about moderation in chat. It is never, effective, changes nothing, and spams chat.
9. **Bots are not allowed**. Humans and sentient organics only.
10. **No hate speech**. This is a quick way to a permanent ban.
11. **No external advertising**. Do not advertise games or websites that do not pertain to tabletop gaming or Tabletop Simulator.
12. **No spamming chat**. You absolutely can advertise your server to try to find players, or ask others to play a game. However you shouldn't be sending it more than once every couple of minutes. There is a server browser to help players find you, they don't need constant chat updates.
13. **Stay on topic**. This is said multiple times, but it is important. Global chat is for discussing Tabletop Simulator, tabletop games, and finding games. We all joke around sometimes, but if chat starts to stray from its purpose, moderators may warn people to keep it on topic. If you want to hang out and shoot the breeze with other Tabletop Simulator players, you can also check out [our Official Discord](https://discord.gg/4EQGtyG).

!!!help "Admin Abuse?"
    If you feel an admin has been abusive please consider the following points:
        1. Be sure the person who was "abused" did not violate any of the above rules.
        2. Please remember that almost all bans/kicks are temporary, and strictly used to cut unproductive conversation.
        3. Please also keep in mind that when you see others kicked/banned, there may be a history to their conversation you are unaware of.

    If you still feel that a moderator has been seriously abusive, you can report it by emailing `berserkgames@gmail.com` with the Steam names involved and a rough timeframe of when it occurred.

##Consequences
Failure to adhere to the above rules can result in a temporary, and rarely permanent, removal from Global chat.

###Kicks
If you break a rule, you can be kicked from chat without cause given. You are allowed to rejoin chat at any time. You are only kicked from Global Chat, not game chat or your game.

###Bans
Our bans are temporary and last 3 hours. After 3 hours, you are able to rejoin Global Chat without issue. This ban is only for Global Chat, it does not prevent you from playing Tabletop Simulator.

###Perma-Bans
There are exceptions made for certain individuals, but these permanent bans are only handed out after repeated or significant abuse. Once banned in this way, you will not be allowed to use Global Chat.
