**When using [Global Chat](in-game-communication#global-chat), there is an expectation that discussion will be centered around Tabletop Simulator, tabletop games and finding games to play.** If you want to hang out and shoot the breeze with other Tabletop Simulator players, you can check out [our Official Discord](https://discord.gg/4EQGtyG).

The global chat is moderated to keep it **on topic** and free of spam/griefing/other negative behaviors. There are bots that auto kick for saying certain words and most profanities will show up as <censored> to everyone except for the person who originally posted it. TTS is considered family friendly, which is why we are moderating the chat. We canâ€™t moderate other parts of the game, but the global chat is easier with the help of our moderators. The global chat is part of the Geekshed network and they have [their own rules](http://www.geekshed.net/tos/) which also need to be followed.

!!!important "Kicks/bans are not permanent. See the [Consequences](#consequences) for details."

##Rules
Rules are open to interpretation. Do not discuss them in chat. See the "Admin Abuse?" section below if you feel they have not been enforced fairly.

1. **Keep chat family friendly.**
2. **Stay on topic.** Finding and discussing games.
3. **Please keep chat in English.** You can private message other players through Steam or by using `/msg <nickname> <message>`
4. **Do not try to get around filters/kicks/bans.**
5. **Do not harass players or moderators.**
6. **Do not complain about games or players.**
7. **Do not discuss chat rules or moderators.** If you do not like something a moderator did, you can ask them why they did it using `/msg name message` in private. If they do not respond, or if you feel they have been abusive, you can contact `berserkgames@gmail.com`.
8. **Bots are not allowed.** No, the ones from Geekshed/Tabletop Simulator are not covered by this rule.
9. **No hate speech. Do not joke about it either.**
10. **No external advertising.** You may advertise your table within reason.
11. **Do not spam chat. Do not participate in group spam.**

!!!help "Admin Abuse?"
    If you feel an admin has been abusive please consider the following points:

    1. Be sure the person who was "abused" did not violate any of the above rules.
    2. Please remember that almost all bans/kicks are temporary, and strictly used to cut unproductive conversation.
    3. Please also keep in mind that when you see others kicked/banned, there may be a history to their conversation you are unaware of.

    If you still feel that a moderator has been seriously abusive, you can report it by emailing `berserkgames@gmail.com` with the Steam names involved and a rough timeframe of when it occurred. **Do not discuss it in chat, please.**

##Consequences
