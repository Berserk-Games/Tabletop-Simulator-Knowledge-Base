We offer both **text chat** and **voice chat** in Tabletop Simulator.

##Text Chat

###Global Chat
When you first log into Tabletop Simulator, on the bottom left of your screen you will see a **Global** tab. This is global chat where you can interact and talk with anyone who is logged in to Tabletop Simulator. It’s a great way to find people to play with, look for play-testers and much more.

!!!attention
    Global chat is moderated and part of the Geekshed IRC network, so please read up on [**the rules here**](chat-rules.md). If you’d like to join the IRC channel outside of Tabletop Simulator, the server is irc.geekshed.net and the channel is #TabletopSimulator. Due to issues with spammers, the following web clients are banned: Mibbit, IRC Cloud and Light IRC.

###Game Chat
Once you click on Single Player or join a Multiplayer game, you will see a second tab called **Game**. The Game tab is used for chatting with anyone currently in your server (if multiplayer). When a new message is posted on a tab you aren’t clicked on, it will highlight gold, letting you know there are new messages.

Any scripting errors or messages printed by scripting are displayed in this chat.

###Team Chat
If you join a team, a third tab will pop up called **Team**. This tab is for private conversation only between you and your teammates.

###Log
A log is available by clicking the **~** tab. The log is visible to all connected players in multiplayer, can be used to display information from scripting and acts as a general game log.

You can modify how the chat window looks by clicking the gear icon in the upper-left of the chat window. You can also un-check **Connect to IRC** to opt out of being logged into Global chat.

You can modify the size of the chat window by clicking and dragging the upper-right corner of its window.

##Voice Chat
Your ability to use a microphone to communicate with those you play with can be modified via the [**Sound** tab of the **Configuration Menu**](configuration-menu#sound). There is a general press-to-talk key which allows you to talk to everyone in your game. There is also a private channel that you can share with only those on the same in-game team.

The default key for press-to-talk is **C** and the default press-to-team-talk is **V**.
