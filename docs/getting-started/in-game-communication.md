Tabletop Simulator has both **text chat** and **voice chat** functionality when you're in a lobby.

##Text Chat

###Game Chat
Once you click on Single Player or join a Multiplayer game, you will see a tab called **Game**. The Game tab is used for chatting with anyone currently in your lobby (if multiplayer). When a new message is posted on a tab you aren’t clicked on, it will highlight gold, letting you know there are new messages.

Any scripting errors or messages **printed** by scripting are displayed in this chat.

###Team Chat
If you join a team, a third tab will pop up called **Team**. This tab is for private conversation only between you and your teammates.

###Log
A log is available by clicking the **~** tab. The log is visible to all connected players in multiplayer, can be used to display information from scripting and acts as a general game log.

##Voice Chat
Your ability to use a microphone to communicate with those you play with can be modified via the [**Sound** tab of the **Configuration Menu**](configuration-menu#sound). There is a general press-to-talk key which allows you to talk to everyone in your game. There is also a private channel that you can share with only those on the same in-game team.

The default key for press-to-talk is **C** and the default press-to-team-talk is **V**.

##Steam Community Chat

The **Tabletop Simulator Community Hub** has a dedicated **Group Chat** that you can use to find lobbies, connect with players and talk about Tabletop Simulator & board games.
You can join this chat by clicking on the **Steam Community Chat** spotlight message or the chat bubble icon above the chatbox.
This will open it up a new Steam chat tab and add a bookmark to the group at the bottom of your Steam Friendslist.
