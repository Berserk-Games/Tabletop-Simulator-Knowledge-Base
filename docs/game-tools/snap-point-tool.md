Snap Points are locations where dropped Objects will gravitate towards. It makes it easy to make cards, tokens, etc land in the right location. Snap points are only visible while using the Snap Point Tool.

    Each Object can have its attraction to Snap Points enabled or disabled using its [context menu](/player-guides/context-menu).

##Snap Point Types
There are 2 types of Snap Points: Snap and Rotation Snap

###Snap

###Rotation Snap

These Snap Points cause Objects to move towards them when dropped as well as rotating to face a pre-determined direction. The points have small arrows around them which, when clicked, change the angle of rotation.

##Placing Snap Points
There are two ways to place Snap Points; attaching them to the table and attaching them to Objects.

###Table Snap Points
With a Snap Point Tool, clicking on the table surface will place a point in that location.

Additionally, if you click on an unlocked Object, a snap point will appear at the Object's center point. This feature makes it easier to place points accurately so your Objects are positioned correctly.

###Object Snap Points
With a Snap Point Tool, clicking on a locked object will place a point in that location on the Object.

If you unlock the Object after the Snap Point is attached, the Snap Point will move with the Object.

##Moving Snap Points
Once a snap point is placed, you are able to move it by mousing over it, holding left-click, and dragging it into position.

Besides moving and rotating Rotation Snap Points, this is the only way to modify existing Snap Points.

##Removing Snap Points
With the Snap-Point Tool selected, left-clicking an existing Snap Point will remove it.

To remove all Snap Points, click on the trash can icon in the Snap Point sub-menu. It becomes visible when selecting the Snap Point tool.
