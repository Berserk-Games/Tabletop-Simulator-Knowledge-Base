There are two types of drawing tools in Tabletop Simulator, **Vector** and **Pixel**. Both drawing tools can be disabled in the Host Permissions under “Painting”.


##Vector Paint

The Vector Paint tool allows for clean, smooth lines on any surface. Limit 10,000 lines per player.

###Sub-Buttons
1. **Draw**: Allows you to place new lines.
2. **Erase**: Removes any vector lines at the location where clicked.
3. **Color**: Select the color of the next line/s drawn.
4. **Erase All**: Removes **all** vector lines from the table.

###Drawing on Objects
"Locking" an object via its [context menu](/getting-started/video-tutorials#contextual-menu) or the keyboard shortcut {>>(Default: L)<<} allows you to draw on the object. When it is unlocked, the drawing will remain (even through save/reloading)!

Unlocked objects will be ignored by the vector paint tool.
