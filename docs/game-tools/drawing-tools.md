###Drawing on Objects
"Locking" an object via its [context menu](../getting-started/video-tutorials.md#contextual-menu) or the keyboard shortcut {>>(Default: L)<<} allows you to draw on the object. When it is unlocked, the drawing will remain (even through save/reloading)!

Unlocked objects will be ignored by the vector paint tool.
