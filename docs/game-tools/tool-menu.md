The tool menu runs down the left side of your screen any time you are in a game. If you join a server instead of hosting, you may be unable to use certain tools. This is because the [host](/getting-started/player-roles.md#host) is able to disable tools in their room using [permissions](/host-guides/permissions.md). As host, you will always be able to see and use all tools, regardless of permissions.

##Grab Tool
This is the first tool and acts as your "hand" in-game. It allows you to pick up, push, and click on any element in the game. It is the default tool.

##Sub-Menus
Some tools have sub-menus that slide out to their left on mouse-over.

##Tooltips
If you ever need to know what a tool does, just mouse-over the item to get a short tooltip reminder.

##Keyboard Shortcuts
If you look in the corner of the tool icon when you mouse-over it, you will see an "F#". This is the keyboard shortcut you can use to select that tool. They are tied to the function keys on most keyboards.

##Selection
The selected tool will have a blue background instead of a white one. Mousing-over a tool gives it a red background, but it is not selected unless clicked.
