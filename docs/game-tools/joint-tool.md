![Joint Tool](/img/joint-tool/joint-tool.png)

The Joint Tool is an **advanced** feature that allows you to connect objects together to create all sorts of things, like spinners, wheels, dials, and more.

You can learn more about Joints in our [Tools Menu Tutorial](https://youtu.be/dGFxC-ideJI?t=1m1s) video.

!!!bug
    Currently, joints do NOT persist if you place the jointed item in a container (like a bag).

##Examples
Below you can find some examples

* [Battle For Souls](https://store.steampowered.com/app/438980/Tabletop_Simulator__Battle_For_Souls/) DLC (Victory Points dial)

##Creating Joints

<center>![Basic Jointing](/img/joint-tool/joint-basic.gif)</center>

With the Joint Tool selected, mouse-over an item and hold left-click. Drag the cursor over the object you want to connect and then release left-click.

!!!tip
    For the best results, always go **FROM** the object **TO** the base.
    
    **Example:** If you are connecting a spinning arrow to a wheel, you would go from the arrow to the wheel, not from the wheel to the arrow.

##Removing Joints
Removing joints is easy. Begin to create a new joint on the object your originally started the joint on, but this time attach it to nothing. This will cause the old joint to detach.


##Modifying Joints

<center>![Modified Jointing](/img/joint-tool/joint-modified.gif)</center>

More than solid joints are available, you just need to modify an existing joint to alter its properties.

* Right-click on the object you started the joint on, and the context menu will appear.
* Clicking on "Joint" will open the Joint menu, which displays the properties of the joint.
    * **Fixed**: A solid joint, not meant to move or twist.
    * **Hinge**: A solid joint that can twist. "Motor" force can also be applied, causing rotation.
    * **Spring**: A flexible joint.
* Each type has its own properties which can be modified to change the joints behavior. Mousing over the `?` next to each property will provide information on what it does.
* When you're done, his Apply or Save & Exit to save the changes.
* Hitting X in the upper right will close the menu without saving any changes.
